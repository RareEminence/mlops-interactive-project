# Interactive MLOps Project: Iris Flower Prediction ðŸŒ¸

This project demonstrates a complete MLOps pipeline, featuring:
- **Model Training**: A decision tree classifier trained on the Iris dataset.
- **Interactive Web App**: Built with Streamlit, allowing real-time user input and predictions.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized and deployed on the cloud for scalability.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.

## Features
- User-friendly sliders for inputting features.
- Real-time predictions and probability visualizations.
- Metrics for monitoring API performance.

## Workflow
1. **Model Development**: Trained a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn.
2. **Interactive App**: Built a web app to serve predictions and visualize results.
3. **Containerization**: Packaged the app with Docker for easy deployment.
4. **Cloud Deployment**: Deployed on [Streamlit Cloud/Google Cloud/AWS] for accessibility.
5. **Monitoring**: Integrated Prometheus to track requests and response times.
